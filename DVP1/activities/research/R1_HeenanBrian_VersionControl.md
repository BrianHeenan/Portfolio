This research paper summarizes my time and effort looking into the topic matter outlined below. I have included links and references to research information used for this activity.    

## Topic: Terminal
Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application. Here's what I have learned...  

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential Linux commands I must know.**

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* clear: Clear the Screen 
* pwd: Print the "Working Directory"
* ls : List files and folders
* ls -a : List files and folders, including invisible files
* ls: List all files and folders, in human readable form
* cd: Change directory
* cd / : Change directory, go to root directory
* cd ~: Change directory and go to user home directory
* cd..: Change directory, go up one folder level
* cd...: Change directory, go up two folder levels
* **cd ~/Desktop/**: Change directory to my desktop!

**2. After Trying this in Terminal, I learned...**

**Folder Drop:** [You cannot drag folders into terminal as it is a text based enviroment]



## Topic: Version Control & Git
Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Here's what I have learned. 

**1. There are three types of version control.**

1. Local Version Control System

All files are maintained on a local system accessible only on that system.

2. Centralized Version Control System

All files are maintained at a central location. Files are checked in and checked out from this location. This is the version control used in the game design degree though the use of perforce.

3. Distributed Version Control System

Files are available from a repository and can be checked out and worked on my many people creating branching history of revisions.

**2. Using Terminal, there are essential Git commands I must know.**

* git clone: Clone a repository
* git config -global user.name "Name": Set-up a global user name
* git config -global user.email "Email".: Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account eMail)
* git status: Show modified files
* git add [file]: Add modified files to the next commit
* git commit -m "comments here": Make a commit with a new message
* git log: Show my commit history
* **git help**: This command will bring up Git's help screen in Terminal!

**3. Authenticating with GitHub from Git.**

Connecting to Github via terminal from beginning.

1)Download Git

2)Set username

3)set your commit email address

4)Connect over HTTPS

â€‹	a. Clone repository with HTTPS link

**4. .gitignore**  
Most repositories contain a .gitignore file. What is the purpose of this file? What is the DST_Store file and why would you want to ignore it? Explain at least one other file or folder you may want to add to a .gitignore file and why.
