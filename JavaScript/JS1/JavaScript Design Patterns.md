	//Varables  must start with either either _ $ or a letter
	//Varables  can contain  either _ $   letter or number
	//Variables cannot begin with number

	//cammelCase is the prefered notation in JavaScript

	//$Variable is generally discouraged in code

	//Constants are immutable  and connot be changed after it is created
	//Constants must be initalized.
	const priceTheNeverChanges = 49.99
	//Best practice Delcare everything that can be a constant as a Const, 
	//then everything else as let
	//avoid Var

	// var is not a prefered method because 
	//it alows you to referance a variable before it is declared and initalized 
	//this can couse some logic and syntax issues to go undandled deespit the code running.
	
	/* 
	showMessage(price)
	var price = 25;

	 if this code was by itself show message would be consided "undefined" 
	 when it was actually never initalized before it was referanced.
	 the let or const keywords would have throw an actual error.
